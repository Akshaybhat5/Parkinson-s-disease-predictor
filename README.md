Parkinson's disease is a brain disorder that leads to shaking, stiffness, and difficulty with walking, balance, and coordination. Parkinson's symptoms usually begin gradually and get worse over time. As the disease progresses, people may have difficulty walking and talking.

It's possible to predict whether the person can suffer from Parkinson's disease or not using Machine Learning algorithms. I've used Randomforest Classifier with the 
accuracy score of 92%, which is tremendous in terms of accuracy and the model best fits.
