The repository consist of :-
1. jupyter notebook
2. python file
3. joblib file

In the jupyter notebook I've cleaned all the messi raw data into a cleaned preprocessed data, analyzed all the outliers, VIf, and assumptions.
Python file contains all the coded cell.
Joblib is the extension of the file to save the model, or to deploy it in any server.
